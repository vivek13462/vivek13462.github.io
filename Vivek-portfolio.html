    <p>&nbsp;I create products & companies. I'm well versed in many skills around technology & product development. I like to build things,usually with technology, and a side of grit. I've worn many hats in my career between executive positions, back-end dev, front-end dev, and product design. I love knowledge, and I strongly believe technology can, and should enrich every single life this universe has to offer.</p>

<h4>Here's what people say about me:</h4>
        
        <p><i>"Vivek Tiwari is one of the most talented, intelligent, consistent and genuinely good hearted people that I have had the opportunity to work with. I've been happy with his performance this summer; bug fixes and tweaks have been done quickly and without bugs. I appreciate how proactive he've been in picking up tickets and tasks, everytime he completed a ticket he was quick to look for work to do, ask around and get stuff done that's a great quality. Strengths:- he've been good at completing tasks, able to jump into existing code and make tweaks quickly and efficiently:- proactive at lookingfor tasks to complete :-willing to learn and explore opportunites."</i></p>
