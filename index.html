    <p>&nbsp;I'm a Full Stack Developer at LifePharm, Inc and I'm passionate about computer programming as a result of the tremendous affect it has had on our world. Programming has and continues to shape the world we live in. Today, with things like social media and personal computers, programming and computer science is more evident in our day to day lives than ever before. I am excited at where programming will take us next. Whether it be another galaxy, quantum computing, or simply a new Facebook, I look forward to being a part of it.

      <p><i>"I enjoyed meeting Vivek and although he came to our team during a time of more analysis and design vs. a ton of coding, the couple things he did get assigned were completed successfully. He met with who he needed to in order to figure out how to complete his tasks. He seems to have a figure it out kind of attitude which was great to see. He does have good coding development knowledge; a few aspects of software development process were very new to him. He did however seem to pick it up pretty quickly. He was very pleasant, and I wish him well on his new team."</i></p>
